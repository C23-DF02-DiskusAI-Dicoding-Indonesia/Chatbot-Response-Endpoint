# Chatbot-Response-Endpoint

This is a simple ML Deployment using flask

## Getting started
### Run Locally
#### Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/C23-DF02-DiskusAI-Dicoding-Indonesia/Chatbot-Response-Endpoint.git
```
#### Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd chatbot
```

#### Install the Required Packages
 Don't forget to activate the virtual enviroment first before running this command
```bash
  pip Install -r requirement.txt
```
This will take a while because of the large size of Tensorflow

#### Start the server

```bash
  python app.py
```
if you can't run that command, try this:
```bash
  flask run
```
Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the main page of your app.
